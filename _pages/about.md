Hello! I am a MD-PhD student in Planetary Health, which is a new collaborative academic field examining how the changing climate affects human health, among other topics. I have completed my second year as a M.D. student at Alpert Medical School, and am currently on leave to complete my Ph.D. at Brown's Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Science working in Professor Baylor [Fox-Kemper's Lab](https://fox-kemper.com/). My environmental science research ranges from simplified statistical models of climate to geoengineering simulations to the mortality impact of heat waves and air pollution. My previous medical research focused on venous thrombosis, carotid revascularization, and optimizing inpatient cardiovascular treatments.

The Brown Daily Herald thought that all this research was interesting enough to do a [profile article](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2023/02/graduate-medical-student-explores-self-designed-graduate-program-in-planetary-health) about me! So if you're interested, check it out!

Outside of research, I love sailing, biking the East Bay, 3d printing, and playing percussion in a volunteer ochestra.
