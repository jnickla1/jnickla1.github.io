## Science Olympiad
I recently volunteered to supervise the Wind Power event for both the 2023-24 [Brown Science Olympiad Invitationals](https://www.brownscioly.com/) and the 2024 RI State Regional Competition at Rhode Island College. For this event, middle- and high-school teams compete by taking a written exam (on wind power and the power grid) and experimentally testing a wind turbine that they designed, constructed, and pre-tested. My responsibilities included writing the exam (for the Brown Invitationals) and bringing the turbine-tester. I meticulously crafted a 20-page written test that could be used not only at the invitational but also as a study guide for subsequent competitions. I included a broad range of questions, some challenging even for engineering graduate students. I re-engineered a turbine-tester, making it repositionable from a safe distance with a counterbalanced arm, and supplanting the multimeter with an [Arduino / Python script](https://github.com/jnickla1/supervisorWindPower) to precisely measure the maximum voltage.

In the past, I have also supervised Simple and Compound Machines from 2019-2021 and Disease Detectives from  2018-2019 for the Brown Science Olympiad Invitational.

## Scribing at Clinica Esperanza
In order to keep up my clinical acumen while I complete my PhD in Environmental Science, I have been volunteering a few times each month as a scribe for [Clinica Esperanza in Providence](https://www.aplacetobehealthy.org/), a free health center devoted to the uninsured. I have worked under two cardiologists, Dr. Pamela Harrop and Dr. Jay Schachne, and one internal medicine hospitalist, Dr. Michael Brabeck.


## Hope's Harvest
Since I was a little boy I loved going to visit relatives' farms to baling hay and gardening in my backyard. [Hope's Harvest Rhode Island](https://www.farmfreshri.org/programs/hopes-harvest/) provides a means for me to go out and work with my hands dirty by gleaning fruits and vegetables for the local food bank. It feels great to help a relatively small band of volunteers harvest several tons of produce (kale, corn, squash, or apples) in a single morning, especially knowing this work will help prevent others from going hungry.
